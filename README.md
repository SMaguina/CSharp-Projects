### Product Inventory Single Page Application

I was given a challenge to create a SPA (Single Page Application) of a product inventory that can display basic CRUD functionalities when products are added, removed, and updated with time tracking capabilities. 
In order to complete this, I used the Knockout.js framework and gained a comprehensive understanding of using this framework within Visual Studio. I created it as a website application in the IDE and coded the observables, view model functions, and data-bindings.
As a result, I able to add the capability to update product information, remove any items in the Inventory list, and add a number digit that keeps track of the amount of items in stock in real-time. So, when an item gets added or removed, the page automatically updates the amount. There is a Timestamp that is also automatically added alongside each item using the new Date property in C#.
